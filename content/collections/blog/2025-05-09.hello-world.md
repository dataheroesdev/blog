It wouldn't even cross my mind having issues with Static Site Generators (SSG). But I guess here I'm after uninstalling <ins>[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)</ins>. Too many problems with local cache (wtf in the first place), but most importantly SCSS compiler is paywalled. Which wouldn't be an issue if it wouldn't be used by 80% of themes. So I decided to go with <ins>[Statamic](https://statamic.com/)</ins>.

I have soft spot in my heart for laravel applications. For some reason the community seems to pour so much love & care for their applications, and it shows. Can't think of one time, when I had negative experience with laravel apps.

So I hope statamic will serve me good, but so far I had a blast setting up this blog. We will see if it can be open source (I would love to), as I haven't played around with configs and deployment.

Hope you will enjoy this blog as much as I enjoy writing about random things. ✌️
