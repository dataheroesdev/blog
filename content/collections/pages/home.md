My name is Matej, and I'm developer based in Europe, Slovakia. I tinker with unix, backend systems & tech in general. 
<br />

I like OSS but most importantly love FOSS. For the majority of my career I've spend my time in sports betting industry, but at the moment I work @ <ins>[rentelligent](https://www.rentelligent.com/)</ins>. 
<br />

On the weekend you can find me doing DIY projects around our Home or spending my time at various race tracks. Yeah I like to drive cars fast.
